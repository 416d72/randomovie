# Introduction

>Ever wanted to watch a movie and needed a suggestion?
You can specify a minimum release year, genres and a minimum IMDB user ratings.
Then you can get a random movie based on your filter any time.

This bot basically provides you the ability to set custom rules then fetch a random movie based on these rules.
It was *inspired* by an obsolete bot called `movie_adviser_bot`, but this one focuses on more simplicity.

# Usage

You can [try this bot now](https://t.me/randomovie_bot).

Or with directly starting chat with user `@randomovie_bot`

# Known bugs:

- Suggestion algorithm is a bit primitive, eg.. you may like Action movies but don't like Sci-Fi movies so you select Action from genres and skip Sci-Fi , Current algorithm may suggest you an Action-Sci-Fi movie because it has at least one genre you set (in this case "Action").

# Movie Database:

Movie database was fetched from [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/).
